# JSDO Core Module

The JSDO Core Module is an implementation of the JSDO used to access the Progress Data Source component. The JSDO can be used by hybrid mobile apps, mobile web apps, and web browser apps to access OpenEdge and Rollbase servers. Other implementations include a client in a mobile Hybrid App (a variation of the browser client), a Telerik® NativeScript client, a Node.js server, and a Java server. The JSDO has successfully been used with servers other than OpenEdge such as Node.js to export data to a Progress® Rollbase Application.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

`npm install @progress/jsdo-core`

### Documentation
Progress® Data Objects in an OpenEdge business application can be accessed using the JSDO on the client. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.progress.com/bundle/data-object-guide/page/Overview-of-Progress-Data-Objects-Services-and-Catalogs.html">Progress Data Objects Guide and Reference.</a>
