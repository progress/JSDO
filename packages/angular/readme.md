# Progress Data Source for Angular
The Progress Data Source for Angular is a TypeScript implementation that extends the JSDO for Angular. This provides a seamless integration between OpenEdge (Progress Data Object Service) with NativeScript and Angular.

### Documentation
Progress® Data Objects in an OpenEdge business application can be accessed using the Progress Data Source on the client. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.progress.com/bundle/data-object-guide/page/Overview-of-Progress-Data-Objects-Services-and-Catalogs.html">Progress Data Objects Guide and Reference.</a>

The Data Source can be used by apps built using Angular.
